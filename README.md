<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Ricardo Acebal</h1>
<h3 align="center"> Web Scraper | Backend Django </h3>

### 💻 &nbsp;About Me 
I'm a passionate self-taught developer who began programming five years ago.
I discovered my true interest in web scraping—every website and its unique structure presents a new challenge that keeps me motivated.
Over time, I honed this skill into a complete workflow: extracting data, cleaning it, and storing it efficiently.
Later, I came across Django, a robust and well-designed framework that enabled me to build powerful web applications and bring my ideas to life.
